abstract: |
  This repository contains the implementation of drift detection, alignment optimization,
  and efficiency engineering techniques for Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RAG).
  The project addresses critical challenges in deploying RAG systems in production
  environments, providing automated drift detection, improved retrieval-generation
  alignment, and GPU-optimized inference pipelines.
